-Added support for building wallet from source (new cmd line options -w, --wallet)
-The genkey option (-w, --genkey) is no longer required and will be autogenerated by the VPS wallet if not supplied
-Temporarily removed the ability to install pre-compiled wallet binaries (defaults back to build wallet from source)
-Changed default port to install as 43879
-Added extra setup instructions before the script is finished for NulleX.conf and masternode.conf setup
-Fix: Update install of an IPv6-bound wallet was not re-creating the IPv6 address after reboot which caused the wallet to fail to start
