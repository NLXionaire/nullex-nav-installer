-Added support for new wallet v1.3.6
-Building the wallet from source now strips debug symbols from nullexd and nullex-cli to make for smaller file sizes
-Removed the maxconnections and addnode lines from the NAV config file
-Removed the entire NulleX.conf section from the final setup instructions for the cold wallet as it is no longer needed
